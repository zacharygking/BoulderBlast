# BoulderBlast
Arcade/Adventure Game
Project #3 for CS32(Data Structures, Algorithms, Object Oriented Programming) at UCLA
I was responsible for the class hierarchy and implementation of the Actor.h Actor.cpp Studentworld.h and Studentworld.cpp files
To run the game the user must link all the files and then change the direction within the main.cpp file to the correct directory of the assets
